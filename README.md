# txt-to-xlsx-automation-project

This Python project processes raw employee attendance data from .Z files and generates a clean, organized CSV file that tracks employee check-ins and check-outs. The program reads multiple input files in a specified folder, removes duplicates, formats the timestamps, and marks the first check of the day as entry and the last check as exit. The output CSV can be opened in Excel for easy review, analysis, and record-keeping.
